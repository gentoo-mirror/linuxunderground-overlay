# app-emulation/dosemu2 :
#
# For now, DosEmu2 is masked because Portage triggers this QA warning :
#
# * QA Notice: The following files contain writable and executable sections
# *  Files with such sections will not work properly (or at all!) on some
# *  architectures/operating systems.  A bug should be filed at
# *  https://bugs.gentoo.org/ to make sure the issue is fixed.
# *  For more information, see:
# *
# *    https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/GNU_stack_quickstart
# *
# *  Please include the following list of files in your report:
# *  Note: Bugs should be filed for the respective maintainers
# *  of the package in question and not hardened@g.o.
# * RWX --- --- usr/bin/mkfatimage16
# * RWX --- --- usr/bin/dosemu.bin
#
#
# Finally, I have to investigate dosemu2-9999.ebuild to know why FreeDos is
# not automatically installed.
